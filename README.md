## Terminal Simulator (Work in Progress)
# Welcome to the Terminal Simulator project! This is a simple Python script that aims to simulate a basic terminal environment. The script is still a work in progress and is open to contributions from the community. Feel free to join us in improving and expanding this project. Your feedback, suggestions, and code contributions are highly encouraged.

## Features
Command Line Interface: The script provides a command-line interface (CLI) that mimics a terminal window, allowing you to interact with simulated directories and commands.

## Navigation: 

You can navigate through simulated directories using the cd command. The available directories are /first, /second, and /third.

## Listing Contents:
 The ls command lists the contents of the current directory.

## Help: 
The help command displays a list of available commands.

## Custom Banner: 
Use the banner command to display a custom banner at the top of the terminal window.

## How to Use
Run the script using a Python interpreter.

You will be presented with a prompt pius@hex:$.

Enter commands to interact with the terminal simulation.

Available Commands
ls: Lists the contents of the current directory.
cd <directory>: Navigates to the specified directory. Available directories: /first, /second, /third.
help: Displays a list of available commands.
banner: Displays a custom banner at the top of the terminal.
